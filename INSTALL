This document describes the steps to install Pycleartool.  This document is
intended for use by ClearCase end-users or administrators, who need to install
a Python interface to ClearCase site-wise or for personal purposes.  


Introduction
============

See the ``README`` file to determine compatibility of your platform and
software before you install Pycleartool.

Pycleartool uses the Python Distribution Utilities (distutils) for the build
and install steps.  If you want to tweak and play with the installation
process, I recommend you to read the `Installing Python Modules`_ document
first.

.. _Installing Python Modules:
   http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html


Installing Pycleartool to the Standard Location
===============================================

From the distribution root directory (i.e. the top-level subdirectory that the
Pycleartool distribution unpacks into), enter the following command at the
prompt (on Windows, open a command prompt window from the distribution root
directory)::

    python setup.py install

This builds and installs the distribution in one run.  The module drops in the
standard Python location for third-party modules.


Installing Pycleartool to an Alternate Location
===============================================

You may want to install Pycleartool to a location other than the standard
location.  For example, you might not have permission to write to the standard
third-party module directory, or you might maintain a personal stash of Python
modules.  The Distutils install command allows you to pick and choose whatever
installation scheme best fits your needs.

If you want to install Pycleartool into your home directory according to the
home scheme, enter the following command at the prompt::

    python setup.py install --home

If you want to install Pycleartool in whatever directory according to the
prefix scheme, enter the following command at the prompt::

    python setup.py install --prefix=custom-directory


Troubleshooting
===============

Unix: unable to execute cc: No such file or directory
-----------------------------------------------------

If it happens that the compiler picked by Python to build Pycleartool is not
available on your box (e.g. because Python was built using the Sun WorkShop
compiler), you can provide the setup script with another compiler.  

For example, if you want to use GNU GCC to build Pycleartool, enter the
following command at the prompt (assuming ksh-like shell)::

    CC=gcc LDSHARED='gcc -G' python setup.py install

Prior to Python version 2.4, ``LDSHARED`` cannot be set on the command-line.
Another solution is to create a symbolic to whatever compiler you want to use
and set the ``PATH`` environment variable accordingly.  Assuming that Python
expects to find a compiler named ``cc``::

    ln -s /opt/sfw/gcc-3/bin/gcc cc
    export PATH=$PATH:.
    python setup.py install

ImportError: No module named cleartool
--------------------------------------

You may encounter this error if you installed Pycleartool to a non-standard
location::

    >>> import cleartool
    ...
    ImportError: No module named cleartool

Read the section `Modifying Python's Search Path`_ from the `Installing Python
Modules`_ document to deal with this error.
